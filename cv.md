```
function evenOrOdd(number) {
  return number % 2 === 0 ? 'Even' : 'Odd';
}
```

- Usage feature-sliced frontend architecture and clear backend architecture.

Some projects have received awards in the rational proposals competition and were presented at conferences.

## Education

I graduated from university as an engineer, which unrelated to programming, but I got programming skills on my own during 2 years.
In April, 2022 I started my traineeship at iTechArt Company as full-stack JavaScript developer and had successfully finished in September. For half a year I had been working with my mentor, making creative, easy-hard projects (using JS, TS, React, Redux, Node), refactoring code, practicing English speaking as well. I had learned the necessary technologies as a future specialist.

## English Language

---

At present my English proficiency level is B1 (Intermediate). I started studying English (from scratch) from the first year at university. I had a lot of practice in special group and by myself. After graduation from university, I continued my studies in the traineeship and work now.
